# schwift.vim
## Syntax highlighting for the schwift programming language

If you're a developer that cares about productivity and hates Mondays, you're
definately using [schwift](https://github.com/natemara/schwift). Now you don't
have to choose between a language that doesn't hate you and syntax
highlighting! Just add this to your vimrc:

```
Plug 'natemara/schwift.vim'
```

And get schwifty!
